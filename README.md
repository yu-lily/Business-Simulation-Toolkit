# Business-Simulation-Toolkit
This repository is a suite of tools to automate interaction with an online buisness simulation, linked below. The included tools allow for automated data scraping, watching and responding to events, parallel actions across many instances, and more. Initially a personal project and not writted to be used by others, this repository is public to serve primarily as a demonstration, but is free to use by anyone who desires.

## Javascript Tools
These tools were written to be used with [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/), [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), or other similar userscript managers.
